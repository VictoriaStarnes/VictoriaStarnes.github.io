My name is Victoria Starnes. I recently started my Masters at Mississippi State University in Wildlife, Fisheries, and Aquaculture. I graduated with my Bachelors degree in Wildlife Biology from Missouri State University in the summer of 2017. I then worked for the Missouri Department of Conservation, or MDC, as a Fisheries Research Assistant. Durring my time at MDC I worked primarily on the Osage and Niangua Rivers located in central Missouri where I was responsible for water quality data collection and assisted with fisheries data collection. I absolutely loved working for MDC, but I felt that I should pursue my Masters degree in order to improve my skills and advance my career. I am excited to join Dr. Colvin's lab at MSU where I will be working on the Bluff Lake Project.
