subtitle: A breif summary of what I did before starting my assistantship at MSU.

My name is Victoria Starnes. I recently started my masters at Mississippi State University in Wildlife, Fisheries, and Aquaculture. I graduated with my bachelors in Wildlife Biology from Missouri State University in the summer of 2017. I then worked for the Missouri Department of Conservation, or MDC, as a Fisheries Research Assitant. In my time at MDC I worked primarily on the Osage and Niangua Rivers located in central Missouri where I was responsible for water quality data collection and assisted with fisheries data collection. I absolutely loved working for MDC, but I felt that I would be able to do better work if I received my masters degree.
