In December I was able to tour Bluff Lake with Steve Reagan, the manager at Sam D. Hamilton Noxubee National Wildlife Refuge. Bluff Lake is actually surrounded by a levees, so we were able to take a driving tour around the entirety of the lake. I loved getting to learn about the refuge and its history from Steve, but one of the most interesting facts was actually unrelated to my project: Apparently the northern levee runs on top of one of the first roads in Mississippi, which unfortunately also served as the trail of tears for many local native american tribes.
