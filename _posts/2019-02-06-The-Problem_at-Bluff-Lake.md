title: The Problem at Bluff Lake
---

Bluff Lake is a 1,200-acre shallow lake on the Sam D. Hamilton Noxubee National Wildlife Refuge managed by the USFWS. Currently the lake undergoes seasonal drawdowns to provide increased forage for migrating waterfowl. However, no attempt has been made to address the ecological impacts of these seasonal drawdowns on the fish and fishery of Bluff Lake. Models of the interactions between drawdowns and water quality, habitat availability, catch rates, size distributions, and trophic relationships need to be created to allow area managers to make informed management decisions. Dependent on yearly sampling, these models could act as a template to assist the USFWS in making management decisions based on current conditions or changing management objectives.
